I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Duke University, with a secondary appointment at the Duke Global Health Institute. I completed my PhD in biostatistics at the University of Washington under Dr. Marco Carone, and previously served as the Director of Research, Monitoring, and Evaluation at Last Mile Health. My research interests include:

* Statistical methods to handle treatment effect heterogeneity in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials
* Survival analysis using machine learning tools
* Global health program evaluation
* Statistical computation and simulation methodology
* Immune correlates of protection analysis in vaccine clinical trials
