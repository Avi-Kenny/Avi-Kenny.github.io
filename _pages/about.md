Welcome to my personal website. I'm a recent graduate of the University of Washington Biostatistics PhD program, where I worked with Dr. Marco Carone. Previously, I served as the Director of Research, Monitoring, and Evaluation at Last Mile Health. My current research interests include:

* Statistical methods to handle treatment effect heterogeneity in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials
* Correlates of protection analysis in vaccine clinical trials
* Survival analysis using machine learning tools
* Evaluation of global health programs
* Electronic data capture and data qualtiy assurance in low-resource settings

Feel free to reach out via email to chat about statistical methods, global health, data quality, woodworking, mushroom foraging, live music, or anything else.
