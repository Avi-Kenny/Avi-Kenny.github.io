Welcome to my personal website. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Duke University, with a secondary appointment at the Duke Global Health Institute. I studied biostatistics at the University of Washington under the supervision of Dr. Marco Carone, and previously served as the Director of Research, Monitoring, and Evaluation at Last Mile Health. My current research interests include:

* Statistical methods to handle treatment effect heterogeneity in stepped wedge cluster randomized trials
* Correlates of protection analysis in vaccine clinical trials
* Survival analysis using machine learning tools
* Evaluation of global health programs
* Electronic data capture and data quality assurance in low-resource settings

Feel free to reach out via email to chat about statistical methods, global health, data quality, woodworking, mushroom foraging, live music, or anything else.
